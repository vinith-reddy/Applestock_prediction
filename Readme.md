# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts Apple stock prices using machine learning models. Various regression techniques are explored and evaluated for accurate price forecasting based on historical data.

## Implementation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/vinith-reddy/Applestock_prediction
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook and open main.ipynb to train and evaluate models:**
    ```
    jupyter notebook Apple_stock_prediction.ipynb
    ```

## Models Explored
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression

## Dataset
- **Dataset Source:** [Apple Stock Price Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ammok/apple_stock_price_from_1980-2021/raw/main/AAPL.csv)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Future Work
- Explore advanced techniques like LSTM for time series forecasting.
- Incorporate external data sources for improved accuracy.
- Enhance feature engineering for capturing market dynamics.

## Recommendation
Further refinement and evaluation are necessary before deploying models in real-world trading scenarios.
